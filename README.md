# SiteSync (Staff4dshire) Platform

Comprehensive workforce, project, compliance, timesheet, incident, and chat platform built with:

- React Native + Expo (`apps/admin-app`, `apps/staff-app`)
- Shared TypeScript SDK and state utilities (`packages/shared`)
- Express + Prisma + PostgreSQL backend (`backend`)
- Socket.io real-time messaging and notifications

This repository is a standalone modern stack and does not depend on the legacy Flutter backend.

- Callout workflow with sign-in origin, arrival confirmation, travel time, and travel distance
- Supervisor and admin approval flows for timesheets and job completions
- Incident reporting with optional images, severity, resolution, and notifications
- Real-time direct chat with media upload, search, read state, and moderation actions
- Notifications with mark-as-read and dismissal controls
- Compliance capture (Fit to Work, RAMS)
- Export support for timesheets (CSV/PDF in staff app workflows)
- Xero integration hooks and payroll notification paths

---

## Architecture Overview

- **Frontend:** React Native + Expo (web + mobile), React Query, React Navigation
- **Shared SDK:** central source for API contracts and client behavior
- **Backend:** Express API + Prisma ORM
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Realtime:** Socket.io for chat and notifications
- **Uploads:** multipart endpoints for chat attachments and profile photos

All role-sensitive operations are enforced server-side (not only in UI).

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
- npm 9+
- PostgreSQL
- Git

Optional:

- Android Studio (Android emulator)
- Xcode (iOS simulator, macOS only)

## Install

From repo root:

```bash
npm install
npm run shared:build
```

## Database setup

```bash
cd backend
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev
npx prisma db seed
cd ..
```

## Run services

Terminal 1 (backend):

```bash
npm run backend:dev
```

Terminal 2 (admin app):

```bash
npm run admin
```

Terminal 3 (staff app):

```bash
npm run staff
```

Press `w` in each Expo terminal to open web.

---

## Environment Configuration

### Backend

Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and configure:

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `DIRECT_URL` (Neon non-pooler URL for Prisma migrations/introspection)
- `JWT_SECRET`
- `EMAIL_FROM` (sender, for example `developer@sitesync.uk`)
- `SMTP_HOST`
- `SMTP_PORT` (usually `587`)
- `SMTP_SECURE` (`false` for 587 STARTTLS, `true` for 465 SSL)
- `SMTP_USER`
- `SMTP_PASS`
- Xero and other optional integration values as needed

For Neon:
- Set `DATABASE_URL` to the pooled (`-pooler`) connection string for app runtime.
- Set `DIRECT_URL` to the non-pooled connection string for Prisma CLI operations.

### Admin / Staff apps

Copy `.env.example` in each app folder:

- `apps/admin-app/.env`
- `apps/staff-app/.env`

Typical local values:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
EXPO_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

For Android emulator, use `10.0.2.2` instead of `localhost`.

## Common Commands

From repo root:

```bash
npm install
npm run shared:build
npm run backend:dev
npm run admin
npm run staff
```

Useful DB commands:

```bash
cd backend
npx prisma studio
npx prisma migrate dev
npx prisma db seed
```

---

## Troubleshooting

## Port conflicts (`EADDRINUSE`)

Use the project guide:

- `docs/backend-port-3001-troubleshooting.md`

Or manually free the port on Windows:

```bash
netstat -ano | findstr :3001
taskkill //PID <PID> //F
```

## Web blank page / QueryClient errors

- Ensure only one clean Expo process per app is running
- Restart with cache clear:
  - `npm run start --workspace=admin-app -- --clear --port 8081`
  - `npm run start --workspace=staff-app -- --clear --port 8082`
- Hard refresh browser (`Ctrl+Shift+R`)

## Shared package changes not reflected

```bash
npm run shared:build
```

Then restart app dev servers.

## Cannot resolve modules

- Delete root `node_modules`
- reinstall via `npm install`
- rebuild shared package

---

## Security & Authorization

- JWT authentication on API
- Role checks in route handlers
- Company scoping on user/project/chat queries
- Server-side enforcement for sensitive chat policies and admin actions

---

---

## Development Conventions

- Keep backend response shapes aligned with `packages/shared/src/models`
- Rebuild `packages/shared` after changing shared source
- Prefer server-side authorization checks in addition to UI restrictions
- Keep role-driven behavior explicit and testable
